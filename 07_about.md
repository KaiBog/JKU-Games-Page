We are a group of students from the technical faculty branch of the student union (ÖH TNF), who love to play games. In order to share this passion with others at JKU, we are organizing the JKU Games, a free gaming event that takes place almost every semester. We can't take all the credit however, as this event builds on the experience and work of all the organizers before us (after all, this is the 18th edition). Also, such an event would not be possible without so many other ÖH TNF members and friends supporting us during the event.

## Awareness Team
Like many of our events, the JKU Games makes use of Awareness Teams. Awareness Team members wear magenta high-vis vests.

Awareness Teams are here to listen to you and ensure that everyone can enjoy the event. If you don't feel comfortable because of a specific person or about a certain situation in our control, or if you simply want to talk, you can always find a member of the Awareness Team. They will handle your request confidentially and bring up your problem anonymously with other relevant members of the Orga Team if necessary. We will then try to sort the issue out as quickly as possible.

If you can't find an Awareness Team member, check in with the Infopoint and have them fetch one for you.<br>
You also reach the Awareness-Team via phone at +49 1567 9305877.

## Got some spare time?
Are you a talented Game-Master looking to host a few games? Do you have an idea for the perfect tournament we are missing and want to organize it? Are you a huge fan of LAN cables and want to share your expertise? Would you like to help us at the event with smaller tasks at the Infopoint, Games Rental, etc.?

We are always happy for your support!<br>
