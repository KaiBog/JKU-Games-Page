## Event time and Resting Period
The JKU Games 2024S will take place from **Friday, 17.05. (16:00)** until **Sunday, 19.05. (06:00)**, for 38 hours non-stop.<br>
On Saturday from **04:00 to 10:00**, the JKU Games Orga team will have a **resting period** and operate at limited capacity. We'll use this time to clean up and prepare the next day, and might even catch an hour of sleep or two as well. <br>
During this time, you can stay at the event and play games but you won't be able to get new ones from our Games Rental section. Our Infopoint will be staffed, but outages in our technical infrastructure might not be fixed as quickly. In other words: This is the perfect time to test our resting area or work on our giant puzzle.

## Async Tournaments

### Chess Champion
<em>Make Magnus proud in this async tournament!</em><br>
In light of logistical considerations regarding space and scheduling, we have devised a unique tournament format. The tournament will span the entire event, and each participant will receive two buttons identifying them as a <em>Challenger.</em><br>
Participants possessing a Challenger button can be challenged to a chess duel at any time during the event. Upon the conclusion of a match, the defeated player will surrender one of their buttons to the victor. The tournament concludes for a player when they have no buttons remaining. Alternatively, if a participant wishes to conclude their challenge period before running out of buttons, they can return their remaining buttons to the Games Rental section and only then the score will be recorded for evaluation at the conclusion of the tournament.<br>
The announcement of the tournament winner is scheduled for 12am (midnight) on Sunday. In case that a winner is no longer present at the JKU Games location, we will contact them to convey their victory.<br>
We look forward to an exciting and competitive chess tournament during the JKU Games!

### Speed-Puzzle Challenge

The quickest one to solve our 49 pieces JKU GAMES SS24-Puzzle will be awarded the title of "JKU GAMES SS24 Puzzle Champion" as well as this year's jigsaw puzzle itself.<br>
That's really all there is to say about it. The challenge will be available at the games rental desk from Friday 4pm till Sunday 12am (midnight). After that we will contact the final record time holder and make sure you receive your prize.<br>
During the Event we will keep you updated about the current record time in the "speed-puzzle-challenge" text channel on our discord.

## Two Rooms and a Boom

This group game will have you protect the president, assassinate him, or sow chaos doing an entirely different task. Of course, not knowing the roles of others, being split up into two rooms without means of communication, and having people sent back and forth between them does not make succeeding any simpler. That's why communication is key.<br>
Two Rooms and a Boom will be played on Friday starting at 19:00 in the Group Games room, where you will get a more in-depth explanation of the rules and roles.
After that, new rounds will start approximately every half hour until 22:30.

## Werewolf

Werewolves are hiding in the peaceful village and are trying to eat all its residents, but the villagers won't just let them do as they please. Meanwhile, some are scheming entirely different plans in secret to use the chaos to their advantage. The question is, can you trust others and their claims of who and what they are?<br>
Werewolf is played almost constantly in the Group Games room, where you will get a more in-depth explanation of the rules and roles.
New rounds are planned to start every full hour (unless the room is needed otherwise) and will be announced via <a href="{{ site.discord_url }}">Discord</a> in the werewolf channel.
