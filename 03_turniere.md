### Cup Stacking (DICE Area) - Saturday, 10pm
<em>A discipline easy to learn, but hard to master.</em><br>
You’re gonna be stacking cups. It’s in the name. It’s not complicated, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy either.<br>

Cups will be provided by us.

### Staring Contest (DICE Area) - Sunday, 2am
<em>Especially enticing for all that have stayed up throughout the whole event, this game will force you to stay awake.</em><br>
In this bracket style tournament, you will be invited to get lost in your opponents eyes. If you blink, you lose!<br>
Please bring the necessary eyes.

## Chess Champion
<em>Make Magnus proud in this async tournament!</em><br>
In light of logistical considerations regarding space and scheduling, we have devised a unique tournament format. The tournament will span the entire event, and each participant will receive two tokens - designated as either <em>amateur</em> or <em>advanced</em> - along with a button identifying them as a <em>Challenger.</em><br>
Participants possessing a Challenger button can be challenged to a chess duel at any time during the event. Upon the conclusion of a match, the defeated player will surrender one of their tokens to the victor. The tournament concludes for a player when they have no tokens remaining. At this point, the Challenger button should be returned to the Games Rental section. Alternatively, if a participant wishes to conclude their challenge period before running out of tokens, they can return the tokens together with the Challenger button to the Games Rental section and only then the score will be recorded for evaluation at the conclusion of the tournament.<br>
The announcement of the tournament winner is scheduled for 12am (midnight) on Sunday. In case that a winner is no longer present at the JKU Games location, we will contact them to convey their victory.<br>
We look forward to an exciting and competitive chess tournament during the JKU Games!

## Two Rooms and a Boom

This group game will have you protect the president, assassinate him, or sow chaos doing an entirely different task. Of course, not knowing the roles of others, being split up into two rooms without means of communication, and having people sent back and forth between them does not make succeeding any simpler. That's why communication is key.<br>
Two Rooms and a Boom will be played on Friday starting at 19:00 in the Group Games room, where you will get a more in-depth explanation of the rules and roles.
After that, new rounds will start approximately every half hour until 22:30.

## Werewolf

Werewolves are hiding in the peaceful village and are trying to eat all its residents, but the villagers won't just let them do as they please. Meanwhile, some are scheming entirely different plans in secret to use the chaos to their advantage. The question is, can you trust others and their claims of who and what they are?<br>
Werewolf is played almost constantly in the Group Games room, where you will get a more in-depth explanation of the rules and roles.
New rounds are planned to start every full hour (unless the room is needed otherwise) and will be announced via <a href="{{ site.discord_url }}">Discord</a> in the werewolf channel.

## Game Store 

During the JKU Games the Game Store Linz will hold Magic the Gathering Events in the Dice Area.<br>
